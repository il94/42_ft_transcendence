## Local installation

- Step 1 : Install and run Docker [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- Step 2 : Clone the project and replace the two ".env-example" file extensions with ".env". You can find them located in the "front" and "back" folders. Variables are already filled, but it's recommended to replace them with your own values.

- Step 3 : On a terminal, go to the project folder and execute :
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

<p align="center">
	After building, your app will be running on the URL specified in the front .env file (localhost:4173 by default).
